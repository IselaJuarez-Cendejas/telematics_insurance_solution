## System Overview

### Problem Statement

Traditional automobile insurance pricing models rely on generalized demographic and historical risk factors such as age, location, vehicle type, and past claims. This approach often fails to reflect actual driving behavior, resulting in:

- Unfair premiums for safe drivers
- Limited incentives for safer driving habits
- Lack of transparency in pricing
- Inability to provide real-time feedback

### Solution Approach

Our telematics-based solution addresses these challenges by:

1. **Real-time Data Collection**: Capturing driving behavior through GPS, accelerometer, and other sensor data
2. **Dynamic Risk Assessment**: Using machine learning algorithms to calculate personalized risk scores
3. **Usage-Based Pricing**: Implementing Pay-As-You-Drive (PAYD) and Pay-How-You-Drive (PHYD) models
4. **Gamification**: Encouraging safer driving through achievements, challenges, and rewards
5. **Real-time Feedback**: Providing immediate coaching and suggestions during trips
6. **Transparency**: Offering clear insights into how driving behavior affects premiums

### Key Benefits

**For Insurance Companies:**
- More accurate risk assessment
- Reduced claims through improved driving behavior

```

### Data Models

**Policyholder Model:**
```python
class Policyholder(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(db.String(36), primary_key=True)
    first_name = db.Column(db.String(50), nullable=False)
    last_name = db.Column(db.String(50), nullable=False)
    date_of_birth = db.Column(db.Date, nullable=False)
    vehicle_make = db.Column(db.String(50), nullable=False)
    vehicle_model = db.Column(db.String(50), nullable=False)
    vehicle_year = db.Column(db.Integer, nullable=False)
    risk_score_current = db.Column(db.Float, default=0.5)
    total_mileage_ytd = db.Column(db.Float, default=0.0)
    avg_harsh_events_per_100km = db.Column(db.Float, default=0.0)
    night_driving_percentage = db.Column(db.Float, default=0.0)
    peak_hour_driving_percentage = db.Column(db.Float, default=0.0)
```

**Trip Model:**
```python
class Trip(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(db.String(36), primary_key=True)
    policyholder_id = db.Column(db.String(36), nullable=False)
    start_timestamp = db.Column(db.DateTime, nullable=False)
    end_timestamp = db.Column(db.DateTime, nullable=False)
    distance_km = db.Column(db.Float, nullable=False)
    duration_minutes = db.Column(db.Float, nullable=False)
    avg_speed_kph = db.Column(db.Float, nullable=False)

    harsh_cornering_count = db.Column(db.Integer, default=0)
    speeding_duration_minutes = db.Column(db.Float, default=0.0)
```

### Risk Scoring Algorithm

The risk scoring algorithm combines multiple factors to calculate a comprehensive risk score:

```python
def calculate_risk_score(policyholder_id):
    # Base risk factors
    harsh_events_score = calculate_harsh_events_score(policyholder_id)
    speed_score = calculate_speed_score(policyholder_id)
    time_score = calculate_time_based_score(policyholder_id)
    mileage_score = calculate_mileage_score(policyholder_id)
    
    # Weighted combination
    weights = {
        'harsh_events': 0.4,
        'speed': 0.3,
        'time': 0.2,
        'mileage': 0.1
    }
    
    risk_score = (
        harsh_events_score * weights['harsh_events'] +
        speed_score * weights['speed'] +
        time_score * weights['time'] +
        mileage_score * weights['mileage']
    )
    
    return min(max(risk_score, 0.0), 1.0)
```

**Risk Score Components:**

1. **Harsh Events Score (40% weight):**
    - Harsh braking frequency
    - Rapid acceleration events
    - Sharp cornering incidents
    - Normalized per 100km driven

2. **Speed Score (30% weight):**
    - Speeding frequency and severity
    - Adherence to speed limits
    - Speed consistency

3. **Time-based Score (20% weight):**
    - Night driving frequency
    - Peak hour driving
    - Weekend vs weekday patterns

4. **Mileage Score (10% weight):**
    - Total annual mileage
    - Trip frequency
    - Distance patterns

### Premium Calculation

```python
def calculate_premium_adjustment(risk_score):
    # Base premium adjustment range: -20% to +30%
    base_discount = -20  # 20% discount for perfect score (0.0)
    max_penalty = 50     # 50% penalty range
    
    # Linear adjustment based on risk score
    adjustment = base_discount + (risk_score * max_penalty)
    
    return round(adjustment, 1)
```
